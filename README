NAME
	slack - Spawn processes with customised timer slack

SYNOPSIS
	slack [-f] ('get' | 'GET' | ('reset' | interval) command [argument] ...)

DESCRIPTION
	Get the current timer slack value or spawn a new process
	with a new timer slack value.

	If the verb get or GET is used, the current timer slack
	value and exit. If get is used, the program shall use
	as high prefix as possible. If GET is used the value
	shall be printed in nanoseconds but not unit shall be
	printed.

	If the verb reset is used, the process shall set the
	timer slack value for the process to the default timer
	slack value, and exec(3) to command.

	If an interval is given, the process shall set the
	timer slack value for the process to interval, and
	exec(3) to command.

	interval must be a positive number, optionally with
	a prefix. Recognised prefixes (and units) are:

	ns, n               nanoseconds (default)
	µs, µ, us, u        microseconds
	ms, m               milliseconds
	s                   seconds

	The default timer slack value is the timer slack value
	on PID 1.

OPTIONS

NOTES
	Real-time threads do not slack around.
